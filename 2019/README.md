# Advent of Code - 2019 solutions
These are a collection of my solutions for the 2019 Advent of Code - https://adventofcode.com/2019. unlike previous years where I've solved these challenges using Python, this year I'm focusing on solutions written for Node.js.

### How to Run
`npm install` to install any dependancies needed by this year.

Each day is broken down into it's own directory, and has at the very least an `inputs.txt` and a `solve.js`. `solve.js` should run and calculate both parts. Additional supporting files may also be included. To run the solution for the day, it should be as simple as `node day01/solve.js`
